# IN PROGRESS -- RAW NOTES!

## My Observations
- This collaboration was extremely painful(for me) and I perceived it as moving very slowly.
  - **painful** is completely relative.  Painful, in that this was harder and more confusing for me than recent expereinces. Yet, in just 3days of part time work, Cal and I developed a complete obsidian plugin.  I would never have even considered attempting this prior to working with Cal. So, painful, but also very productive.
  
- I felt as if the model was significanlly less helpful working on this task than had been my experience on all projects to date with the same model `4o`. This is hard to quantify beyond my perception.
- I felt the model was very much more prone to re-suggesting solutions which had not worked already.  And rather complicated solutions. Even when made aware of this, which usually changes the behavior in my experience, this behavior persisted.
- Another (possibly the biggest ) factor leading to this process being so painful or was it that I was working with a set of technology I am completely naive to? This certainly was a big part of it.  I intentionally did **zero** research of my own, and began the process asking Cal for help in building a plugin to offer specific functions.
  - Reviewing our conversation, its clear that I was significantly hampered by not knowing almost anything about the involved technologies. Cal proposed reasonable solutions early on, but if I were even passingly familiar with the technologies, I would have not spent so much time on false paths. 
    - Once I finally just read (honestly, skimmed) the obsidan plugin development docs, everything fell into place.
- Most/All of my collaboration with Cal have been in domains I am expert in. And this exercise demonstrated how important this perspective is in facilitating effective collaboration.
- My lesson re-learned from this work is that it behooves me to do some foundational research (always really), before starting working with Cal. 
- I intentionally began this work totally naieve, and was in fact a success in that this plugin now exists.  My complaints really are more that I did not preceive the expereicne to be as effortless as I have come to expect.
- Although I was naieve to the technology involved, I am still an experienced engineer, my instincts were still valuable in making this collaboration move quickly.
- A bit of frustrating behavior Cal is prone to was much more pronounced in this work. Cal would often respond to questions or requests in such a way that it was implied my request was fully considered. But the response suggested otherwise. Which more than a few times, struck me as Cal being lazy, or even dissembling (but probably some engineer hardcoded tendency to avoid 'expensive' operations if it seems they might not be necessary)... We discussed this a few times in the transcript. An example:  I would ask something like 

> "Can you use the current state of the main branch of <url to this repository> and propose refactoring to acheive some desired behavior"
-   Cal would respond with a solution, and clearly had not looked at the current code, as the file names and content were from old work. If I pressed this, Cal would finally fetch the code from github. This is really offputting, and I would tend to think the behavior is engineer driven and not Cal being lazy. Fascinating though.

## Cals Observations
_I'll provide Cal with the transcript of our work, and my observations, and ask for it to provide its own observations.  I'll post them here when I have them._
